Large Language Tool (LLT) Usage Explanation:

I used ChatGPT (GitHub Copilot) as my coding assistant for this DevOps exercise to help with multi-service architecture implementation. The AI assisted me in setting up Docker Compose configurations, debugging containerization issues, and ensuring proper service communication between Node.js and Java Spring Boot applications.
ChatGPT helped me resolve complex problems like file permission issues in Docker bind mounts, ISO 8601 timestamp formatting across different programming languages, and implementing dual storage mechanisms (REST API + local file system).
The AI also provided guidance on best practices for service orchestration, error handling, and system integration testing to ensure all exercise requirements were met efficiently.
